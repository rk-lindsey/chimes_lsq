## Instructions for fitting ChIMES models in "A Generalized Machine-Learning Framework for Developing Alchemical Many-Body Interaction Models for Polymer Grafted Nanoparticles"

Melody Y. Zhang, Shih-Kuang (Alex) Lee, Sharon C. Glotzer, and Rebecca K. Lindsey

The ChIMES model fitting in the paper includes fits to two-body and many-body potential of mean force (PMF) data. Many-body PMFs are estimated as the sum of two-body and three-body interactions. To reproduce these fits, please download the PMF training data from the DeepBlue database hosted by the University of Michigan(https://doi.org/10.7302/s3rm-vd81).
